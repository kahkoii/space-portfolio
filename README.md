# Space-Themed Portfolio Site
This is a small fun project I have wanted to work on for some time, and its simply a React application made to showcase my development portfolio. The main libraries used to make this are chakra-ui and react-router-dom, and this project uses the standard create-react-app build scripts. 

Live preview of the site should be available at [kahho.tech](https://kahho.tech)
